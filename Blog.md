Dodge Beer project blog

Hello, my name is Abil and I am currently a third year
computer science and mathematics student at the 
University of Victoria. I have recently become interested
in probability theory, and really felt like applying all the 
knowledge gained from my degree into one project, while 
also having fun.

The project revolves around the game of dodge beer, and the 
amateur tournament which is run by me and my friends. It is 
a drinking game. I will be (a) Setting up the data collection,
(b) Storing Data, (c) Analyzing data. If time allows I would also 
like to use MCMC (Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo) to run simulations
of the tournament with different team compositions.

(a) The collection of data is quite straight forward. Games will 
be played, and I will collect: Player, Drink of choice, Game number, against whom played, hits made, saves made, cans drunk, turns taken to win.

(b) This part is handled by Ali. During the tournament our database
will be multiple sheets of paper.

(c) I will be using R to interpret the data. Right now I have a couple of questions which I want answered: Who is the MVP, What is the ranking of players, What was the best team, What was the worst team, Graph Hit% and Liquor Drank, Save% and Liquor Drank.
